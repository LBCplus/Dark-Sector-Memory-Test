title: "Dark Sector Memory Test: Probing Dark Matter and Dark Energy History-Dependence via Cluster Mergers"
abstract: >-
  A model-agnostic observational framework for testing whether gravitational 
  lensing encodes kinematic history beyond the instantaneous matter distribution.
  Tests predictions from superfluid dark matter, non-Markovian EFT, and nonlocal 
  gravity using morphological correlations between lensing residuals and merger 
  kinematics in galaxy clusters. This is the first systematic test for dark-sector
  memory effects in gravitational lensing.
